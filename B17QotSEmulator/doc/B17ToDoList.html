<h4>Bug Reports</h4>
<ol>
	<li /><a href="http://com4.runboard.com/bb17qotsemulator.fbugreports.t26">BUG</a>: When I lose a crewmember, if I click on him in the airman tab, to see what his stats were, I get an error message (I think it was a string error, but I didn't write it down), then it crashes to desktop. When I try to relaunch, I get a "run-time error '380': invalid property value" I've reinstalled it and it runs fine, just when I do that (the quick answer is 'so don't do that') it kills the game. This has happened three times to me now, though. (kfgreer1961, 8 Dec 2004) <b><font color="#00aa00">Fix in 1.0b2</font></b> (if it works)
	<p />
	<font size="-1">
The error is occuring in the modAirman.bas module, in the FillAirmanTabFields() function, on this line:
<p />
.cboAssignment.ListIndex = prsAirman![Assignment]
<p />
The airman's assignment is 7, but there are only six items in the combo. The problem though, isn't that his plane (Hunters Honey II) is not in the combo -- because it is. The problem is that I am using a keyfield (7) to do an index to an array. Rather than trying to find where that keyfield occurs in the array, then pointing at that array element.
<p />
I'm not sure why I haven't run into that before, considering all the missions I've run. Especially since that piece of code is accessed on a near constant basis ...
<p />
<b>I think I have this licked, but need to test it some more ...</b>
<p />
<b>Similar (same?) Issue</b>: Preston - Getting a runtime error code of 380 - Invalid property value when trying to add crewman - don't understand why. I click ok and the emulator boots out. I may end up having to do a reinstall.

<!--
The problem -- I am certain -- is that it is trying to do a lookup in a disabled dropdown of a value which does not exist in the dropdown, due to the dropdown being dynamically populated/depopulated/repopulated at various points in the program.
	<p />
Next time it happens, zip up the mdb (database) file, and mail it to me. I may be able to spot the problem in there. (Something may not have been set properly when he was killed ...) It's definitely a program problem, though, data may just be the symptom.

	<li /><a href="http://com4.runboard.com/bb17qotsemulator.fbugreports.t2">BUG</a>: I was busy fighting off a fighter wave. As I went to assign mg fire, as I clicked on the nose guns I got the following error message, run time error "9". (MikeMarie) Am pretty sure it crashed when I selected the nose gun to assign fire. The RTE was very quick and then the emulator crashed out and closed. (SonBae)

<h4>To Do List</h4>

<p />

<font size="-1">These mods are going to have to wait until v2.0.</font>

<p />


<ol>
	<li />Add Tom Cundiff's 9th and 12th AF North African bases variant. (That is where Ploesti was launched from.)
	<p />
	<li /><font color="#aa00aa"><b>These purple mods have similar issues.</b></font>
	<p />
	<li /><font color="#aa00aa">Shuttle missions from England to Russia or Italy, and Italy to Russia.</font>
	<p />
	<li /><font color="#aa00aa">ALTERNATE TARGETS: This will require a DB mod for designating&frasl;determining an alternate for each target.</font>
	<p />
	<li /><font color="#aa00aa">Crashland in neutral territory if it is within fuel range: Sweden, if the target is Kiel, Heide, Tutow, Peenemunde, Swinemunde or Stettin; Switzerland, if the target is Friedrichshaven, Munich, Augsburg, Ulm, Bingen, Mulhouse, Dijon or Lyon; Russian territory, if the target is Berlin, Dresden, Salzburg, Prague or Pilsen, and the date is January, 1945, or later. (option)</font>
	<p />
	<li />Print a damage summary after the mission ends.
	<p />
	<li />Change the look of each maintenance tab to contain a spreadsheet, so the user can see&#47;modify more than one record at a time.
	<p />
	<li />Create screen to allow the user to manually set fighter cover, rather requiring random fighter cover. (option)
	<p />
	<li />Add sound. This may be difficult as testing with about a half dozen different techniques (including Windows APIs) has proven very unsatisfactory. 
	<p />
	<li />Use alternate B-3 tables. (option)
	<p />
	<li /><b><font color="#ff0000">TODO: add a save button with an actual save file dialog</font></b> to the mission log RTF box.
	<p />
	<li />Mission save should generate bomber-specific positions, ammo, etc.
	<p />
	<li />Implement awards system. (The current awards fields are place holders created for this future feature.) Make the awards compliant with those that existed from 1942-1945. Maybe use "Hero Points", accumulated during the mission for different acts, as a measure of what awards to give out.
	<p />
	<li />Use British terms where British planes are used.
	<p />
	<li />Record missions, histories, etc. to some sort of log file.
	<p />
	<li />Track more bomber-specific stats.
	<p />
	<li />Save mission that is in progress. (aka, 'cheat' feature)
	<p />
</ol>
