B-17: Queen of the Skies emulator


Originally written by Preston V. McMurry III.

B17QotS is based on Avalon-Hill's "B-17: Queen of the Skies", a solo board game of WWII aerial combat over Europe.

It includes support for several variants, including Preston’s B-24 variant (included).

I’ve started working on maintaining/improving it to fit the rules-as-written better, and to offer more interaction where reasonable.

See read_me_1st.txt for more details.
