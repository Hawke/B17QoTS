The primary purpose of a group is to associate a bomber with a particular air force, for the purpose of determining what missions are available for the bomber to fly.

<p />

<b><u>Name</u>:</b> Scrolling through the list of names will open the unit history for the listed group. Other than adding a new group, name cannot be modified. 

<p />

<b><u>Commander</u>:</b> A change of command may be performed by choosing another commander from the list.

<p />

<b><u>Base</u>:</b> The group may be transferred between the 8th (England) and 15th (Italy) Air Forces by clicking the base button.

<p />

<b><u>Unit History</u>:</b> Lists the units sorties, kills, casualties and awards.

<p />

<b><u>Default</u>:</b> Indicates that the group is a default unit. Default groups cannot be deleted. The default groups are:

<blockquote>
	<u>455th Bomb Group</u>: The default group for Italy. The 455th was home to the Dakota Queen.
	<p />
	<u>6 Group</u>: A default group for England. 6 Group was home to KB726.
	<p />
	<u>91st Bomb Group</u>: A default group for England. The 91st led the assault on Schweinfurt on August 17, 1943, and was home to the Memphis Belle.

<b><u>Notes</u>:</b>
<ol>
	<li />To add a group, overwrite the current group's name, then select commander and base, then click the Add button. 
	<p />
	<li />Only the group's commander and base may be updated.
	<p />
	<li />A group can not be deleted if it has assigned squadrons. Each squadron must be deleted or assigned to a different group before the group may be deleted. Default groups can not be deleted.
	<p />
	<li />No restriction, other than common sense, is placed on what ranks may hold what command billets. Likewise on the number of groups or squadrons an airman may command.
