The primary purpose of a squadron is to control the general types of planes assigned to the Air Force's smallest unit, and to link planes to a group's base information. 

<p />

<b><u>Name</u>:</b> Scrolling through the list of names will open the unit history for the listed squadron. Other than adding a new squadron, name cannot be modified. 

<p />

<b><u>Commander</u>:</b> A change of command may be performed by choosing another commander from the list.

<p />

<b><u>Group</u>:</b> The group the squadron is assigned to. The squadron may be transferred by choosing another group from the list.

<p />

<b><u>Bomber Type</u>:</b> All planes in a squadron must be of the same basic type: Either B-17s, B-24s or Avro Lancasters, though the specific model does not matter. It cannot be modified. 

<p />

<b><u>Unit History</u>:</b> Lists the units sorties, kills, casualties and awards. It cannot be modified.

<p />

<b><u>Default</u>:</b> Indicates that the squadron is a default unit. Default squadrons cannot be deleted. The default squadrons are:

<blockquote>
	<u>324th Bomb Squadron</u>: The default B-17 squadron. The 324th was home to the Memphis Belle.
	<p />
	<u>741st Bomb Squadron</u>: The default B-24 squadron. The 741st was home to the Dakota Queen.
	<p />
	<u>No 419 Squadron</u>: The default Avro Lancaster squadron. No 419 was home to KB726.
	<p />
</blockquote>

<b><u>Notes</u>:</b>
<ol>
	<li />To add a squadron, overwrite the current squadron's name, then select commander, group and bomber type, then click the Add button. 
	<p />
	<li />The squadron's commander and group may be updated.
	<p />
	<li />A squadron can not be deleted if it has assigned bombers. Each bomber must be deleted or assigned to a different squadron before the squadron may be deleted. Deleting a squadron does not affect a group's unit history. Default squadrons can not be deleted.
	<p />
	<li />No restriction, other than common sense, is placed on what ranks may hold what command billets. Likewise on the number of groups or squadrons an airman may command.
	<p />
