
Revised table B-3 for B-17: QOTS

This contribution owes itself to three observation.  It is completely
unplaytested but perhaps over time and with feedback it could become
something great!

1) Having lost one crew after another in various B-17 games due
   to ahistorically strong fighter opposition I finally have to change
   the rules and cheat!  I was really interested in Bruce Peckham's 
   variant fighter rules.  However, in practice I found it too easy to 
   always remove those pesky vertical dives and attacks that I knew 
   were more dangerous so I then missed the drama that results.  My 
   first 15 missions using Bruce's variant have been somewhat anticlimactic...

2) I've noticed that table B-3 is very overworked and that
   it is easy to show that the small number statistics in the table
   result in some unrealistic preferences for certain sides of attack
   for various fighter types.  More on that below...

3) In addition, table B-3 is now complicated by numerious official and 
   unofficial variants trying to model the behavior of the GAF
   resistance over time.  Adding fun features like rocket attacks
   JU-88, JG-26, and other temporal variants like those by Preston McMurray 
   in his excellent B-24 variant and Jets all require additional bookkeeping.
   A recreated table might be a great way to do that.

My solution is (instead tacking on even more to B-3) is to finally admit
that its time to just revamp the Attacking Figher Wave Table altogether.  
Bruce's idea is perfect -- just allow fewer fighters per wave on average.  
However, to preserve the "cold equations feel" the fighters should not be 
selected by the player (as with allied fighter cover).  The old tables
imply a lot of knowledge about the behavior of German fighter tactics
so I learn as much as I can from them before discarding them.
At the same time, the new tables can model how the nature of ETO air 
combat changed with time.

Where my tables come from....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to keep as much of the designer's intent as possible so first let's
look at table B-3.  I'm almost guaranteed to make an error as I threw this
together during an all night shift at the observatory where I work when it
was cloudy.

First off, let's examine the distributions of the number of fighters
generated by table B-3.

Number of fighters per wave in table B-3
----------------------------------------

Fighters Generated  - Number of results - Total fighters 
        0                    6                 0
        1                    6                 6
        2                    8                16
        3                    7                21
        4                    6                24
        5                    3                15
     
       ---                  36                82

The expectation when rolling on B-3 is that I will
face 2.3 fighters that can fire upon and damage my B-17.
On an average length mission (5 sectors) and an average
gazetteer (-2, -1, -1, -1, 0) I can expect to roll
on table B-3 something like 7 times and therefore
something like 16 german fighters single my fort out
for attacks.  If they're all head-on and average pilots
I am almost guaranteed fighter damage.

On the major missions I can accept that, but on my
way to a milk-run not really.  Let's keep going though.

Number of fighters types per wave in table B-3
------------------------------------------------------
Types of Fighters   - Number of results  -  Percentage
        0                    6                16.7
        1                   24                66.7
        2                    5                13.8
        3                    1                 2.8         


Frequency of Appearance by Type in table B-3:
---------------------------------------------

Type      Fraction of appearances             Percentage
FW 190            34/82                          41.4
ME 109            36/82                          43.9
ME 110            12/82                          14.7

Not much to say here -- obviously the big-boys come one
in equal proportions with the 110's pressed into service as
they're able.

Level of appearance in table B-3:
---------------------------------

Type           Fraction of appearances        Percentage
High                38/82                        46.3
Level               24/82                        29.3
Low                 14/82                        17.1
Vertical Dive        4/82                         4.9
Vertical Climb       2/82                         2.4

Most attacks are from above or level.  Historically accurate...

Level of appearance in table B-3 for FW190:
-------------------------------------------

High                21/34                        61.7
Level                7/34                        20.6
Low                  4/34                        11.8
Vertical Dive        2/34                         5.9
Vertical Climb       0/34                         0.0

This seems to imply that the FW190's service ceiling is
higher than the Fort's since the attacks come from above. 
I don't have a problem buying that one a bit.

Level of appearance in table B-3 for ME109:
High                17/36                        47.1
Level               15/36                        41.7
Low                  2/36                         5.6
Vertical Dive        2/36                         5.6
Vertical Climb       0/36                         0.0

The ME 109's ceiling is comparable with a Fort.


Level of appearance in table B-3 for ME110:
High                 0/12                         0.0
Level                2/12                        16.7
Low                  8/12                        66.6
Vertical Dive        0/12                         0.0
Vertical Climb       2/12                        16.7

The ME 110 has problems operating that high.  All of
this adds up to my general agreement with the proportion
of attacks as a function of level.  Now let's see how
B-3 handles the angle for attacks....

General Angle of Attack in table B-3

 12:00              28/82                        34.2  
 10:30              11/82                        13.4
  1:30              12/82                        14.6
  3:00              10/82                        12.2
  9:00               8/82                         9.8
  6:00               7/82                         8.5
Vertical             6/82                         7.3

In the aggregate this table looks acceptable as well.
Some slight deviations (the Starboard waist gunner
gets more targets than the port) but it seems
okay on the whole.  Until, at least, you break it
down by type of plane:

General Angle of Attack in table B-3 for FW190

 12:00              11/34                        32.4
 10:30               5/34                        14.7
  1:30               5/34                        14.7
  3:00               6/34                        17.6
  9:00               3/34                         8.8
  6:00               2/34                         5.9
Vertical             2/34                         5.9

What is it about the Starboard side that the FW190 likes?
It is twice as likely to attack from that angle!

General Angle of Attack in table B-3 for ME109

 12:00              14/36                        38.9
 10:30               3/36                         8.3
  1:30               7/36                        19.4
  3:00               4/36                        11.1
  9:00               2/36                         5.6
  6:00               4/36                        11.1
Vertical             2/36                         5.6

Likewise, there are some strange results here.  The
Starboard gunner gets twice as many cracks at a 109
and the Starboard cheek guns gets way more than twice as
many attacks.

General Angle of Attack in table B-3 for ME110

 12:00               2/12                        16.7
 10:30               3/12                        25.0
  1:30               1/12                         8.3
  3:00               0/12                         0.0
  9:00               1/12                         8.3
  6:00               3/12                        25.0
Vertical             2/12                        16.7

This balances out the net statistics a bit but
again, only the port gunners get much of a chance to
shoot at these guys....

Anyway, we just need more even treatments.  It's impossible
to do with only 36 results -- but what about creating a few
more?

My proposal
-----------

Where Bruce generates how good the formation is I propose we
just rank the fighter opposition for the day.  The table
has four categories ("Token", "Light", "Moderate" and
"Heavy") similar to flak.  These numbers used to select an 
opposition table to use for the day which then controls the
mean number of fighters you'll face.  TO begin, assume that
as advertised table B-3 is accurate for 1942 - Early 1943
but that it represents the worst case resistance.  Medium
resistance would be a grade easier, Light two grades, 
and No resistance three grades easier.  Using my earlier
analysis, I would suggest the following tables:

Heavy Resistance 

Fighters Generated  - Number of results - Total fighters
        0                    6                 0
        1                    6                 6
        2                    8                16
        3                    7                21
        4                    6                24
        5                    3                15
(Expect 2.3 fighters per roll, 16 on the average 5 zone mission) 

Medium Resistance 

Fighters Generated  - Number of results - Total fighters
        0                   12                 0
        1                    8                 8
        2                    7                14
        3                    6                18
        4                    3                12
        5                    0                 0
(Expect 1.4 fighters per roll, 10 on the average 5 zone mission) 

Light Resistance

Fighters Generated  - Number of results - Total fighters
        0                   20                 0
        1                    7                 7
        2                    6                12
        3                    3                 9
        4                    0                 0
        5                    0                 0
(Expect 0.8 fighters per roll, 6 on the average 5 zone mission) 

Token Resistance

Fighters Generated  - Number of results - Total fighters
        0                   27                 0
        1                    6                 6
        2                    3                 6
        3                    0                 0
        4                    0                 0
        5                    0                 0
(Expect 0.3 fighters per roll, 2 on the average 5 zone mission) 

We can now use these tables to insert a GAF that is bleeding out
over time:

        08/42-12/43      1/44-9/44        9/44-4/45
1         Light          Light             Token
2         Light          Light             Token
3         Medium         Light             Token
4         Medium         Medium            Light
5         Heavy          Medium            Light
6         Heavy          Heavy             Medium

The three enclosed charts were generated from the information presented
above.  Each attack was statistically generated using the results above
(except where I smoothed out asymmetries in the angles of attack).  
Vertical Climbs and Dives were only generated by the angle of attack, not
by the level of the attack.  At the same time as many variants as I 
could easily find were incorporated into the notes.
