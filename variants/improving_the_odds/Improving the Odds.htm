<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Thanks to Bruce Peckham for the following variant. 
We may use this for our next 25!</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Improving The Odds</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The way to improving the odds for B17s in the game 
is to cut down the number of German fighters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>This can be done in a fashion that is historically 
consistent. In Donald Caldwell’s book "JG 26" one of the quoted Luftwaffe pilots 
stated that German fighter pilots looked for ragged formations and stragglers 
preferring to attack them than a tight disciplined B17 combat box 
formation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>We could improve the present odds in QOS by 
implementing formation integrity for each B17 squadron which when good or 
excellent cuts down on the number of attacking enemy fighters. The GM calculates 
formation integrity during pre-mission preparation using historical factors of 
weather and crew experience</FONT><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>. </FONT></P></B>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>A chart is designed for the GM to use at the start 
of each mission that defines the formation for each squadron as Tight, Normal or 
Loose. The better the formation, the better the chance of encountering fewer 
fighters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The chart is a simple percentage chart with results 
modified for two of the prime factors that determined formation integrity, 
weather and crew experience. German fighter activity and flak also affected the 
formations, but as we do not fly zone to zone, but rather the entire mission we 
can’t easily use these additional factors for our purpose in this online 
game.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>My proposal is that if the formation is Tight then 
no extra fighters appear for the lead and tail bombers and one attacker is 
removed from each wave. If the formation is Normal then one fighter is removed 
from each wave. If the formation is loose then all attacks are played per the 
normal QOS procedures.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>An out of formation B17 is gamed in accordance with 
the standard QOS rule for that situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Using percentage dice the chance of the formation 
types are: 20% Tight or Loose. 60% Normal.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>1. Modifiers are determined as 
follows:</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Weather:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If the QOS pre-mission chart O-1 calls for good 
weather at both base and target there is no modification to the Formation 
Integrity Chart.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If either the base or target shows poor weather roll 
1d6. A roll of 6 is inclement weather on the mission. All other results are good 
weather.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If either base or target shows bad weather roll 1d6. 
A roll of 4-6 is inclement weather.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If both base and target are poor or bad then the 
mission weather is automatically inclement.</FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Under inclement weather conditions add 10% to the 
percentage roll on the Formation Integrity Chart.</FONT></P></B>
<P><B><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>2. Crew Experience</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Crew experience is calculated pre-mission by the GM 
as follows: Total the mission count for each squadron’s available B17s but 
exclude the two B17s with the highest and lowest mission count. Divide this 
total by the aggregate number of available B17s (including the two previous 
exclusions). Fractions are retained. This quotient is the Squadron Crew 
Experience Factor (SCE). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The percentage roll on the Formation Integrity Chart 
is affected by comparing SCE to the number of combat zones on the current 
mission. Changes to the chart result are made only under the following 
conditions:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>SCE exceeds the number of mission zones by 2 or more 
subtract 10% to roll.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>SCE is less than the number of mission zones by more 
than 2 adds 10% to roll.</FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If Squadron Crew Experience exceeds or is below the 
number of combat zones on the current mission by a factor of 2 add or subtract 
10% to the percentage roll on the Formation Integrity Chart.</FONT></P></B>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>The GM does all the work and notifies each squadron 
what its formation will be for the mission. The player must remember the 
modifications to fighter attacks if his squadron is in a tight or normal 
formation. This isn’t a radical change. The present odds are not made worse. The 
missions will not be dull milk runs. But there is a chance for a better chance. 
My own Shady Lady was shot down by one shot from one fighter. Maybe she’d be 
still flying if the formation had been nice and tight that day.</FONT></P>
