<p><b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p>
<p>In November of 1943, the RAF embarked on a campaign which was expected to
finally bring the Third Reich to its knees. The target was Berlin and the
British authorities were confident that its success would not only shorten the
war, but also would prove once and for all to their American &quot;cousins&quot;
the folly of daylight bombing. The introduction of the &quot;Oboe&quot; and
&quot;MS&quot; radar systems, and the formation of the Pathfinder Force had
aided Bomber Command in making great strides in the area of night bombing since
those early days in 1940. In that year, a report from the War Cabinet
Secretariat stated that not only did bomber crews rarely find their targets, but
they even less frequently hit them.</p>
<p>By 1943, Bomber Command's tactics were aimed at Germany's heavy industry
centers. The strategy was not only to destroy the factories, but also the homes,
morale and lives of the civilian population. Successes in the first campaigns
against the Ruhr Valley and Hamburg had given the British good reason for their
high expectations against the German capital; but the Luftwaffe's night fighter
force (NACHTJAGD) had also made great strides since 1940.</p>
<p>Gone were the days when German pilots complained that trying to intercept a
bomber at night was like &quot;trying to catch a fly in a darkened room&quot;.
Advances in airborne radar played a major role in the improvement of the
NACHTJAGD's performance. New radar equipment was developed which could not be
jammed by &quot;window&quot; techniques and which could home-in on the
navigational and tail-warning radars used in British bombers. New tactics were
also implemented in 1943 which divided the NACHTJAGD into &quot;Tame Boar&quot;
and &quot;Wild Boar&quot; units. &quot;Tame Boar&quot; units employed
radar-equipped</p>
<p>twin-engine fighters which stalked British bombers alone, relying on ground
radar and their own airborne sets to locate targets. &quot;Wild Boar&quot;
tactics, on the other hand, called for singleengine fighters without radar to
operate over the target itself. &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighters would attack
British bombers which were illuminated by searchlights or the raiders' own
marker flares. Both the improved radar and the new tactics helped make the
NACHTJAGD &quot;uncomfortably efficient&quot; by the Fall of 1943. From a force
of 35 in 1940, the NACHTJAGD reached a peak strength of almost 600 &quot;Tame
Boar&quot; and &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighters by March, 1944.</p>
<p>By its conclusion, the Battle of Berlin was the greatest assault ever to be
launched against a European city. Between November, 1943 and March, 1944, Bomber
Command flew over 20,000 sorties in 35 major operations against Berlin and 12
other German cities. Over half of the sorties were against the German capital.
In the end, the British had to make the painful admission that they had failed
to pound Hitler's capital or his nation into submission. The cost was 1,047
bombers lost and 1,682 damaged. On the German side, the NACHTJAGD reached the
highwater mark of its existence on the last night of the campaign-March 30/31,
1944. On that night, of the 781 bombers sent to Nuremburg, &quot;Tame Boar&quot;
fighters were credited with destroying 80 of the 108 British aircraft lost. As
for the British, the one bright spot was the emergence of the Lancaster as the
mainstay of Bomber Command -the British &quot;Queen of the Skies&quot;.</p>
<p><b>VARIANT RULES</b></p>
<p>Except for the rule changes listed below, all other rules from B-17, QUEEN OF
THE SKIES remain in effect.</p>
<p><b>THE COMBATANTS:</b></p>
<p>You are now the commander of a British Lancaster heavy bomber. The Lancaster
was a four engine bomber, but had some marked differences from the B-17. The
Lancaster only had a crew of 7: Pilot, Bomb Aimer, Navigator, Flight Engineer,
Radio Operator, Mid-upper Turret Gunner and Tail Gunner. For defensive fire, the
Lancaster carried eight machine guns: Two in each of the nose and mid-upper
turrets and four in the tail turret. Unfortunately, the Lancaster was armed with
the less powerful .303 Browning machine gun. The tail guns were supplied with
10,000 rounds of ammo which was located in the forward part of the waist
compartment, and carried by tracks back to the tail guns. The bomb bay was
underneath the aircraft, being situated beneath the pilot and waist
compartments. Although Lancasters were being supplied with radar sets by 1943,
for simplicity this aspect has not been included.</p>
<p>Your adversaries will be the Me-110 &quot;Tame Boar&quot; fighter and the
Me-109 &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter. The Me-110 was the backbone of the
NACHTJAGD in the early years, but by 1943 was being supplanted in that role by
newer types. &quot;Wild Boar&quot; tactics were implemented after the successful
British raid on Hamburg in July, 1943.</p>
<p><b>1. PRE-MISSION STEPS</b></p>
<p>A. Because of the &quot;bomber stream&quot; tactics employed by Bomber
Command, it is not necessary to roll for your bomber's position in the squadron
or formation. Your bomber is never considered to be &quot;out of
formation&quot;, but it may drop to 10,000 feet due to battle damage.</p>
<p>B. Roll for the target city on the Mission Targets table (G-3 [L]) on the
following page:</p>
<p>C. Examination of the Flight Log Gazetteer (Table G-11 [L]) is necessary only
when your bomber is shot down and you need to know if you are over land or
water.</p>
<p>D. Place bomber marker on Bomber Command Base on Lancaster Strategic Movement
Board.</p>
<p><b>2. MISSION STEPS</b></p>
<p>A. Do not roll for fighter cover. There is no fighter coverage available at
any time during these missions.</p>
<p>B. As your bomber enters a zone, determine if it will be attacked by a
&quot;Tame Boar&quot; fighter by rolling 1D on the &quot;Tame Boar&quot; table
(B-2 [L]):</p>
<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: All Table references follow the style of the original B-17
rules. All Tables unique to this article are labelled as per their counterparts
in B-17, with the addition of a bracketed &quot;L&quot; [L] for
&quot;Lancaster&quot; (i.e., G-3 [L]).</p>
<p>C. When your bomber enters the target zone, the following sequence of play
occurs:</p>
<p>1. Weather Phase</p>
<p>2. &quot;Tame Boar&quot; Phase (treat as TO TARGET on Table B-2 [L])</p>
<p>3. Searchlight Phase 4. Flak Phase</p>
<p>5. &quot;Wild Boar&quot; Phase 6. Bomb Run</p>
<p>7. &quot;Tame Boar&quot; Phase (treat as FROM TARGET on Table B-2 [Q)</p>
<p><b>3. COMBAT PROCEDURES FOR &quot;TAME BOAR&quot; FIGHTERS</b></p>
<p>A. An attacking German &quot;Tame Boar&quot; fighter will always be a single
Me-110 attacking from the 6 O'clock Low position.</p>
<p>B. The Me-110 will always make three attacks (Initial and both Successive
attacks) unless destroyed or having received a FBOA damage result from Table
M-2.</p>
<p>C. Spotting Phase l. Roll 1D:</p>
<p>1, 2 = Me-110 spotted by Tail Gunner; 3-6 = Me-110 approaches unseen.</p>
<p>2. If the Me-110 is spotted, then:</p>
<p>a. Follow normal rules for combat.</p>
<p>b. Bomber may take evasive action during Initial attack after defensive fire,
but before offensive fire. This means that the Me-110 will be affected by the
evasive action modifier, but the Tail Gunner will not (at least for the Initial
attack).</p>
<p>c. Once the bomber takes evasive action, it must do so throughout all of the
present turn's attacks. (See Section 15, page 8 for Evasive Action Rules.)</p>
<p>d. Mid-upper Turret may only fire at the Me110 if the bomber is taking
evasive action. Mid-upper Turret can not fire in the Initial attack, only in the
Successive attacks. The Mid-upper turret's field of fire is the same as that of
the B-17 Top turret.</p>
<p>3. If Me-110 is not spotted, then:</p>
<p>a. Me-110 fires first in Surprise Offensive Fire Phase. Me-110 fires only
once during this phase, and no defensive fire is allowed.</p>
<p>b. After Surprise Phase, resolve combat as per above in section 3.C.2 of
these rules. </p>
<p>D. Offensive/Defensive Fire</p>
<p>1. The Tail Guns need a die roll of 5 or 6 to hit the attacking Me- I 10.</p>
<p>2. The Tail Guns will receive the +1 modifier when rolling on Table M-2 only
if all four tail guns are operational.</p>
<p>3. If bomber is taking evasive action, all defensive fire from the bomber
needs a die roll of &quot;6&quot; to hit attacking German fighters.</p>
<p>4. Me-110 needs a die roll of 4-6 to hit the bomber.</p>
<p>5. During the surprise offensive fire phase, an Me-110 can roll a 3-6 to hit
the bomber. 6. If an Me-110 hits the bomber, roll 2D on Table B-4 to determine
number of hits.</p>
<p>a. Use 6 O'clock position during surprise offensive fire phase only.</p>
<p>b. Use Vertical Climb position for all other attacks.</p>
<p>c. Do not add &quot;1&quot; to the number of shell hits achieved by an Me-110
&quot;Tame Boar&quot;.</p>
<p>7. For each shell hit, roll 2D on the Area Damage Table (B-5 [L]) to
determine the area of the bomber which is affected:</p>
<p><b>4. COMBAT PROCEDURES FOR &quot;WILD BOAR&quot;FIGHTER</b></p>
<p>A. &quot;Wild Boar&quot; attacks take place only over the target zone, and
the &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter is always an Me-109.</p>
<p>B. The &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter attacks on a die roll of &quot;6&quot;,
or automatically if your bomber is spotted by a searchlight.</p>
<p>C. Attack Phase</p>
<p>1. Roll 2D on TABLE B-6 SUCCESSIVE ATTACKS to determine attack position.</p>
<p>2. Only one &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter will attack at a time.</p>
<p>3. If a &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter was generated by the bomber's being
spotted by a searchlight, conduct normal combat procedures (initial and any
successive attacks).</p>
<p>4. If a &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter was generated by die roll, only one
(initial) attack occurs.</p>
<p>5. All Offensive and Defensive fire is modified by -1. A &quot;6&quot; is
always a hit, regardless of modifiers.</p>
<p>D. &quot;Wild Boar&quot; attacks take place after Flak attacks, but before
the bomb run.</p>
<p>E. Your bomber may take evasive action during the &quot;Wild Boar&quot;
phase, but the bomb run is then modified by -1.</p>
<p><b>5. TARGET ZONE PHASE</b></p>
<p>A. Roll for weather on the &quot;Weather Over Target table (O-1 [L]).</p>
<p>1. Also use Table O-1 [L] for weather over base when returning from a
mission.</p>
<p>2. Use modifiers on Table O-1 to determine effect weather has on mission (if
any).</p>
<p>B. Roll for &quot;Tame Boar&quot; Fighter</p>
<p>1. Use same rules as mentioned in section II, B and section III of these
rules.</p>
<p>2. Bad or poor weather will modify the possibility of attack by &quot;Tame
Boar&quot; fighters and spotting phase die rolls by -1.</p>
<p>C. Roll for Searchlight Phase</p>
<p>1. Roll 1D: 1-4 = No Effect; 5-6 = Searchlight has spotted and is fixed on
your bomber. a. Die roll on Table 0-2 is modified by +1. b. Bomber is
automatically attacked by a &quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter.</p>
<p>2. Bad or poor weather will modify the searchlight die roll by -1.</p>
<p>D. Resolve &quot;Flak Over Target&quot; as per the basic game rules.</p>
<p>E. Roll for &quot;Wild Boar&quot; Fighter.</p>
<p>1. Refer to Section 4 of these rules.</p>
<p>2. There is no die roll for a &quot;Wild Boar&quot; if one has already been
generated in the Searchlight Phase. Your bomber will be attacked by only one
&quot;Wild Boar&quot; fighter while over the target zone.</p>
<p>F. Conduct your Bomb Run as per the basic game rules.</p>
<p>l. Cities in the Ruhr Valley were in range of the &quot;Oboe&quot; apparatus,
which proved to be a much better navigational system than the H2S radar.
Therefore, if your mission is to Essen or Leverkusen, modify the &quot;Bomb
Run&quot; die roll on Table O-6 by +1.</p>
<p>G. Roll for &quot;Tame Boar&quot; Fighter.</p>
<p><b>6. CAMPAIGN GAME</b></p>
<p>A. You're in the RAF now! Tour of duty is 30 missions.</p>
<p>B. To add a touch more realism, increase the tour of duty to 60 missions. RAF
personnel were expected to &quot;volunteer&quot; for a second tour of 30
missions.</p>
<p><b>7. MISCELLANEOUS</b></p>
<p>A. Nose and Mid-upper Turrets do not receive the +1 modifier for twin guns on
Table M-2.</p>
<p>B. The Tail gunner may not fire at German fighters attacking from the front
as they pass the rear of the bomber (9.2).</p>
<p>C. Since your bomber is never considered to be out of formation, you may
never abort a mission for this reason.</p>
<p>D. On the Mission Chart, use the Nose and Top Turret ammo boxes for the Nose
and Mid-upper Turrets, respectively. For the Tail Guns, use the ammo boxes for
the Port Waist, Starboard Waist and Tail Guns combined.</p>
<p>E. The Random Events Table is never used. If you get a die roll referring you
to this table, roll again until you receive another result.</p>
<p>F. If the Tail Guns run out of ammunition, they may not transfer ammo from
the other guns, nor may they lend their ammo to the other guns.</p>
<p>G. If your bomber is forced to 10,000 feet by battle damage, roll for
searchlights in the searchlight phase. If a searchlight finds your bomber, roll
2D three times instead of twice on the Light Flak column of Table O-3.</p>
<p>H. If your bomber loses one engine and you drop bombs to avoid spending two
turns in each zone, your mission is automatically aborted, but still counts
toward your tour-of-duty requirements.</p>
<p>I. Ignore any die roll result for the Radio Room; if such a result is
obtained, roll again until you receive another result.</p>
