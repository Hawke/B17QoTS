<P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>German Jets in B-17, Queen of the Skies 
<BR><BR><B>Appearance</B> <BR><BR>1. There is a chance that jets will appear 
when a 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 or 65 is rolled on Table B-3. Roll 1D for each 
regularly appearing Me-109 or FW-190, do not make this roll for the additional 
ME-109 appearing due to lead/tail bomber position or Out of Formation effect. 
<BR><BR>2. Jets only appear in Zones over Germany. <BR><BR>3. If a "6" is rolled 
replace the regular plane with a jet marker, ME-109 becomes ME-163 and FW-190 
becomes ME-262. <BR><BR>4. Roll for pilot quality as per normal rules. 
<BR><BR><B>Defensive Fire </B><BR><BR>1. Only power assisted turrets (Chin 
Turret, Top Turret, Ball Turret &amp; Tail Guns) may attempt to attack the 
jets.&nbsp; <BR><BR>2. After assigning fire but before rolling to hit each gun 
must attempt to track the target. Roll 1D for each weapon. On a roll of "6" the 
gun successfully tracks, ACE bonuses do not apply, jet and my fire. If the gun 
was not able to track the target no ammo is used but the gun cannot fire at any 
other fighter. (This represents the difficulty aiming at such fast moving 
targets) <BR><BR>3. All to hit rolls made against the jets have a modifier of 
-1, a roll of a "6" still hits. The ACE bonus can be used. (This represents the 
difficulty hitting such fast moving targets). <BR><BR>4. If the jet is hit the 
twin gun bonuses apples against the ME-262. Against the ME-163 there is an 
additional +1 bonus for a total of +2 on Table M-2. <BR><BR>5. The Tail Guns 
passing fire option is not allowed against jets <BR><BR><B>Offensive Fire 
</B><BR><BR>1. Roll for German Offensive Fire normally, Table M-3. <BR><BR>2. On 
Table B-4 (Shell Hits By Area) use the following modifiers:<BR><BR>ME-262: 
multiply the number of shell hits by 2 <BR>ME-163: add one to the number of 
shell hits <BR><BR><B>Rockets </B><BR><BR>Note: This section was vague in the 
briefing and I think the moderators used this as a option to level the playing 
field or just to be sadistic. - Anthony's opinion <BR><BR>The ME-262s sometimes 
carried air-to-air rockets. If you are attacked by an ME-262 please inform a 
moderator immediately and he will determine if your bomber is subjected to a 
rocket attack. <BR><BR>If your bomber is subjected to a rocket attack roll on 
Table O-3, Flak to Hit B-17, 2x under the Light Flak column. If your bomber is 
hit follow the Flak hit procedure.</FONT></P>
